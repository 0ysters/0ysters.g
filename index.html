the closet and fuucking hardcore but the nerd me a the coauther r we said that since nobody would be checkign up no them they could be 
doing anything like having a meaningful conversation so tristan thought that on the 100th turn with her he would ask her out and when

me but i foound out bitch got a crush on me like a few days before the party si bitch asks coolfag to fucking invit me to the party

shit i got fired but then i was w8 no hes gonna rape me but then i was like shit its after work time and he pulls out his bong and hes 
like k bro ur gonna smoke wee d 2 day and i was like yippie and then we smoked aand it wass kinda crazy so i was likeplaying with his dog
and it was like i was a dog but i wasnt and then i ate a bean burrito cuz i was like having the unchies big time crazzy realsies but the
twist is that i have like 0 like for bean burritos but then when i was high i did like burritos of beans i talked to one of the friends
of the kid that let me smoke his weed and he was like when ur high ur not a different person its just like a window to what u realy r 
cuz i was like bro when ur sober u dont like mustard but when ur high u do like it it so i was holy sht is this a nother personality or 
wutt anyway i didnt know how or where to get weed after that but i still wanted to get high so i was like household items that can get u 
high at google and it was like nutmeg but thats bs so i was like wut else and it was like air duster and i was like hey i think mommie 
got some of that so i was like doing it and when i got high i was like yippie cuz it actually worked so i was doing a ton of that and 
everybody was like shit bra u gotta stop but not mommie or dado feg so i was like i this kids house mathississ brother alecses parents 
house and i was like hey bro do u got some air duster and he was like yes and i got hiigh af then he told his parents and i was like 
fuck and they caem to my house and did a fucking intervention i was like fuck and then i didnt really do it anymore so i started 
druinking i drank anything and sometimes my parents thought i was drunk but then i stareted acting drunk so they would think that im 
weird af but then i found my parents jagermister and i knew that it was strong af but it tasted so good that i just wanted to drink 
more and more and i drunk like 3 fourths of a bottle so i was like vomiting and stuff and i think i conffesed like every time that i 
had gotten drunk or high oops<br><br>

im a degenerate i smoke a lot of marijuana about 4 hits each day usually after school my bus drops me off everytime it starts off as 
mee not thinking im high at all but then like in a tv show ive done some thing very stupid and i dont realize for a while but then when 
i do its like who turns out i was actually high af like just the other day i opened my window and climbed out to go smoke outside far 
away from my house so the smell couldnt be detected by my parentses face mounted smell detecters so ya know i was out there i took my 
shirt off so the smell wouldnt get on it and i was smokin it up and after like 4 ish hits i thought that i wouldnt go back in to my house 
through my window until i got high so im waiting and im like god dammint i just wont get high so i think to myself ill start walking bak 
and itll get my blood flowing so i start walking bak and i dont real feel it kicking it i get to my window and im sad but then i look at 
my feet and theyre full of cactus needles i must have gone out of my way to trample every cactus possible and then im just like yeaaaa 
im highh i spent a few minutes after that picking the needles out of my feet but i ended up doing my home learning out of guilt i dont 
remember too well but i think i did it so when my parents found out they might think that weed actually helps that excuse probably sounds 
better if youre high<br><br>

Deep in the heart of New Mexico, in Santa Fe, in a large, wealthy house, Artur wakes up from his bed. As the goes to the kitchen to eat his very expensive cereal, he passes a large, ominous door, and sighs.

“I wish I could trick someone into my basement dungeon.” Artur says. “So far, the only person in there is Tristan.”

Faint wailing is heard from the door, but Artur bangs on it to shut it up and moves on.

He eats his cereal, and goes to school. “Maybe this will be the day I finally get someone to love me.” he says.

When he arrives at school, he finds Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar tinkering on a large, mysterious machine.

“We’re done!” Sevar shouts as he throws up his arms!

“This calls for a toast!” Oisin cries, throwing back three glasses of bourbon.

“What is that?” Artur asks.

“We finally finished our cloning machine!” Malcolm says excitedly. “We need something small to test it on. What about you?”

“Okay.” Artur shrugs and walks into the cloning machine. A few seconds later, two Arturs walk out.

“WOW!” Artur says. “Who are you?”

“I’m Artur!” Artur replies. “Who are you?”

“I’m Artur…”

“Looks like the test run worked.” Oisin says. “Let’s test it on more stuff!”

Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar excitedly start testing the cloning machine further, leaving the two Arturs by themselves.

“So… what do you wanna do?”

“I don’t know. Let’s play chess!”

The two Arturs play chess for a while, but every game ends in a draw, and they eventually get bored and go home.

“You know, this is a lot more boring than I thought it would be. We’re just doing things that we do normally.”

“Well, there are things we could do together that we couldn’t do alone…”

Artur glanced knowingly at the bulge in Artur’s pants that seemed to have appeared out of thin air. Artur licked his lips, revealing a lizard-like appendage. 

“What’s…” Artur cooed, seductively, hovering an eager hand above the XXL-sized member. Due to the size, he had to raise his hand all the way up, parallel, as a choir of angels sang to accompany the action. “This?”

“Oh…” Artur realized what was going on. “Hot dog!” He exclaims in a Mickey Mouse voice.

The two Arturs close their eyes and reevaluate their lives as they realize what they’re about to do. “I haven’t thought about whale sharks in a long time.” They sing in unison before embracing each other and making sweet, sweet love.

Artur slowly pushes Artur’s pants down to his ankles, then his Spongebob-themed thong down, too. He pushes Artur down onto the chess board. Artur moans and Artur looks at his partner in confusion. He hadn’t even touched him yet. To Artur’s surprise, Artur’s puckered, virgin asshole had been penetrated by a stray bishop.

“Oh, God!” Artur screamed. “For I have never felt such pain nor pleasure in my life!”

Deciding to go with the flow, Artur flipped his partner over and proceeded to move the chess piece in a slow circular motion, slowly expanding his hole. In an aggressive move of passion, he shoved the piece inside. When he attempted to retrieve it, it could not be found.

“Well, fuck,” Artur felt defeated.

“What happened?” Artur asked.

“Uh… guess we might have trouble counting the pieces later,” Artur started to think. 

“What the fu-” Artur started to say, only to be cut off by an overwhelming sense of fullness.

“Shit,” Artur knit his eyebrows. “I slipped in :(“

The entire 16 inches of Artur’s throbbing fish cock was pushing the Artur’s inner walls apart, prodding at his stomach, pushing the chess piece further into Artur’s body.

Artur was surprised by the feeling he experienced from the chess piece, but as soon as it was inside him he could not deny the pleasure. He turned his head to the side and saw his keys. Artur hadn’t used these in some time but he realized he had a new purpose for them.

He crawled forward revealing the enormous lizard cock of Artur.

“I know we have a connection, and I know that you would want me to experience the most pleasure… right?” asked Artur.

“Yea, of course” said Artur.

“Well could you grab my keys” Artur asked.

Artur reached his hand out and grabbed Artur’s keys. Once he held them in his hand he realized what Artur wanted. Artur thrusted his hand into Artur’s anus, then he shoves the other hand with the keys in it now with both his hands inside of Artur he reached up into his sternum and unlocked his heart. Artur now understood the true meaning of Thanksgiving, I mean, love.

He felt like he could trust Artur with anything, he could barely speak with so much Artur in one skin, he decided he would communicate with Artur through their lovemaking. But then he got bored of talking, so he decided to switch it up a bit. He reached under his bed and pulled out his pet octopus, named Sucky because of his suction cups.

He explained to Artur, “This is an albino octopus I gave birth to after an octopus saved me from drowning and impregnated me in return. I want you to get him in my ass.”

“Come here little guy. I won’t hurt you.” said Artur.

Reluctantly the octopus climbed up Artur’s leg and felt the smooth, prepubescent sphincter of Artur. It climbed inside of him and, familiar with Artur’s insides, found his placenta and started feeding.

“Oh my,” Artur said, “I haven’t felt that feeling in months.”

“With me, you can feel it anytime.” Artur said. “I’m much slimier than an octopus.”

“Prove it.” Artur said, biting his lip and grinning cheekily.

Artur obliges, climbing inside Artur and filling him with slime, almost as if he was an enormous amoeba. He searches around inside Artur, experimenting with what he can do from the inside. He pulls on a nerve, and Artur jerks his arm.

“Hey, stop that!” Artur says.

“Wait, I want to see what I can do.” Artur says, yanking another nerve. This time, Artur steps forward.

“Can you stop now?” Artur asks.

“No, this is fun!” Artur says. Before long, Artur is doing the chicken dance. “Fine, I’ll stop now.” Artur says. He climbs out, bringing the bishop and keys with him, and the two Arturs, completely exhausted from their adventures, finally go to sleep.

The next morning, the two Arturs wake up and look at each other lovingly.

“I had a great time last night.”

“So did I. But I feel we can do better.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, last night was fun, but it wasn’t fun enough. Isn’t there a way that we can boost the fun for each of us?”

“Well, I suppose we could see the full capabilities of the cloning machine…”

The two Arturs go back to the cloning machine, where Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar are still working.

“Hey, Artur, how was your time being cloned?” Sevar asks.

“It was fun. There were some cloning defects… Maybe I wasn’t as small as you thought.” Artur smiles as he recalls the fun times he had with his inhuman apparati.

“We can fix that, if you want.” Oisin hiccups. “We just figured out how to un-clone things.”

“No, no!” Artur says. “I very much enjoy being two people. In fact, that’s why I came here. I want another clone.”

“Another one? I’m not sure if the world can handle that many Arturs.” Malcolm says. Everyone starts laughing.

“Well, it won’t necessarily be me… rather, a part of me, multiple times. Can you do that?” Artur asks.

“I’m not sure.” Sevar responds. “We’ll see what we can do.” He flips on one of the many switches on the machine. “Okay, try it now.”

“Great!” One of the Arturs jumps into the cloning machine, and out walks him and another Artur, except instead of a front side, he just has another back side!

“WOW!” The newest Artur says. “What’s this? I don’t have a face or anything!”

“That’s okay.” Artur says. “You won’t need one for what we want you for.”

The three Arturs return home for another round.
