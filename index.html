Introduction
This paper compasses some of those which, in society, try to influence you and how they do so; as well as, analyzes how much of one’s opinion is actually their opinion. In particular, advertisers’ and politicians’ theories on influence. Advertisers use advertisements which are optimized for selling goods through psychology. Politicians also use advertisements and additionally they make public appearances where they get another chance to influence you. The techniques used by either are based on the same understandings of persuasion, emotion, and the rationalization process. Being educated about the aforementioned understandings increases efficient and rational consuming (Giang).
Advertisers
Advertisers create advertisements based on two established psychological templates: one that appeals emotionally and focuses on the experience of owning a product, and one that provides fact-based information to lead the buyer to objectively make their purchase. Emotion’s importance is greater than logic’s importance in decision-making, according to Brian Ahearn
No matter how much we’d like to believe we’re rational creatures who occasionally act emotionally, the truth is, we’re actually emotional beings who occasionally act rationally.” (Ahearn).
Dan Ariely and others’ research supports this, but only theories exist to explain why -- a namely irrational choice theory which says that rationally and emotionally influenced decision-making coexists. Although some research concludes humans actually do try to maximize gain at all cost, for instance, the Rational Choice Theory, it is limited and arguably people irrationally judge outcomes while in very emotional situations (Giang).
Brian Ahearn believes the explanation has to do with how “words create pictures, picture lead to feelings, and feelings culminate in actions.” A curious online survey by him shows that more than nine in ten participants would prefer owning over buying, investing overspending, and an inexpensive car over a cheap car. He hypothesizes that it’s because people prefer words that create pictures that lead to positive feelings. Salespeople know this and they explain owning a product or enjoying it’s benefits and not spending money. While creating an advert, a marketer will use investing over spending because investing connotes a valuable return. However, evidently, it is not guaranteed as almost 10% did not react this way (Ahearn).
Purchase decision-making process begins when the consumer realizes that they have some need or a problem to solve. The realization must be triggered by either internal stimuli like hunger or by external stimuli like advertising. The consumer then searches for information to find the best solution. After finding a product that they feel suits their needs the purchase is made. However, the purchase could still be stopped by negative reviews or, the consumer usually considers these when searching for information but Euan Johnson explains:
Having gone through the previous three stages, a customer chooses to buy a new telescope. However, because his very good friend, a keen astronomer, gives him negative feedback, he will then be bound to change his preference.
This example how consumers value feedback when making an important purchase a consumer will appreciate a product with negative feedback more than a product with no feedback. Even the emotionally swayed consumer can simply not afford to buy a product that they don’t know much about. Finally, the consumer will use the product to determine whether their expectations where proper which affects brand loyalty, an entire industry itself (Johnson).
During the decision-making process, the bias of a person is why similar people looking to solve similar problems will purchase different products. The next paragraphs’ examples help to understand bias. To promote objective decision-making they disclose common tendencies that people exhibit and explain how they affect people’s conclusions.
People tend to consider facts that support one conclusion and tend to disregard facts that conclude otherwise, this results in an uninformed decision.
People also tend to filter out information demeaned insignificant which may contribute to the aforementioned tendency by filtering out facts we deem insignificant.
People tend to have a conservative approach to adapting our thought patterns when negotiating unfamiliar situations this can happen when the consumer researches upgrades for a product they already own and they don’t consider the latest innovation in an industry; conserving their outdated research scope.
Attribution asymmetry is the tendency to credit our talents for our success, to associate our failures with external setbacks, to connect the success of others with luck, and to accredit others’ failures to their mistakes which can help coping with failure but distorting one’s ability to see their own faults can be very unhealthy in the long run. 
Confirmation bias is when an opinion/assumption that is created before researching something is corroborated, this results in unreasonable trust in a source. One can mitigate negative effects from confirmation bias by trying to dispute one’s assumptions with other plausible possibilities.
Anchoring is a tendency to make uninformed decisions because of how it is difficult to open one’s mind after capturing a first impression. Anchoring is best prevented rather than responded to, to stop making anchored decisions just look back on past decisions and identify whether you’ve been anchoring if so make sure to invest more time into research.
The Gambler’s Fallacy is a tendency that makes one believe that past event affect the present. Mindtools.com explains:
A classic example is a coin toss. If you toss a coin and get heads seven times consecutively, you might assume that there's a higher chance that you'll toss tails the eighth time.
A study in 2008 showed that assessing information out of chronological order decreased the likelihood on experiencing the Gambler’s Fallacy. Understanding how the brain see patterns can overall help you become a more efficient thinker. The brain looks for meaningful characteristics that can be organized into a rule that when applied to a concept can help approximate unknowns. In terms of the Gambler’s Fallacy the pattern is based on our brain expect the outcomes to be split approximately evenly between head and tails and we think tails is more likely because that would follow the rule.
An important and common tendency to address is called overconfidence bias which manifests itself as irrational confidence in one’s knowledge and people sometimes estimate situations too specifically and end up being unprepared. To prevent making  decisions based on the merit of your mind one can recruit a control researcher that can help gather information that they trust and assess the credibility of sources together because recognizing irrational confidence logically cannot be dealt with effectively by the person who is over confidant.
Informational advertising/product based - logic based advertising, this approach focuses on presenting the product’s features, benefits, performance, and/or comparisons with competing products’ effects. Presenting fact-based information leads the buyer to an informed and logical decision (Boykin).
Transformational advertising/user based advertising - this method is emotion based, the emotional appeals of a company seem to substitute logic with an intuitive judgment based on how a person feels about a company. The role of the brand is very important, it creates a bond with consumers that can bring more success than the product could achieve on its own. Brand love nullifies the purchase decision-making process, during the final stage of the decision-making process a positive experience can change a single purchase consumer to a loyal customer (Boykin).
Even though your brain has this mechanism in place: studies conclude that delaying decisions as much as possible can make it easier to accurately judge a situation because emotions usually fade if given the time. This was noticeably observed when Korea instituted a six-month delay after filing for divorce and the beginning of proceedings and it is the reason why the US waits six days after giving a marriage certificate and marrying a couple.
Politicians
Politicians pursue hire in political positions, they participate in the most competitive and arguably most important industry on the planet. Commonly, politicians are thought to campaign to show their opinions. However, politicians actual campaign for how their solution to a problem is the correct one. For example, the US Republican Party candidate will usually present the Trickle-down economics theory, or a version of it, to address the continuing prosperity of our economy and the US Democratic Party candidate will usually propose a modernized version of the Robin Hood tax system. Both are showing an opinion that being: their preference of one solution over another. However, the actual reason they debate is to present evidence for why their solution is correct. This evidence can range from claiming to have received the information from god to empirical data from past implementations.
Although it seems unlikely that a person claiming to be able to prophesy the future is unlikely, ambiguity can be exploited enough that two or more parties will always form if society allows. One key technique, named the Equivocation Fallacy, that uses the ambiguity of the meaning of a word or statement to communicate an idea using a meaning of the word different from the meaning of the of the same word in another part of the argument (Hanks).
Analysis
Neuropsychology has recently received an appropriate increase in attention. An increase in research has lead to many helpful developments in technology that let us enjoy our lives much more. Personally, I am very excited about how the world is modernizing, instead of looking at how these techniques are abused to sell me things I try to appreciate how almost every aspect of my life has become appealing. The next-generation consoles from 2017 are relevant examples. Companies have invested in studying appeal and the result is more products that psychologically looks cool and feels premium to the touch. The PlayStation 4 is a monochromatic, black, minimalist, and uniquely designed console. This contributes to brand recognition which can trigger the first step in the purchase decision-making process and the neutrality of it also allows it to be photogenic in any setting which can help distinguish it during the information search step. 
The reversed nature of modern innovation due to how modern technology works; to understand one must be able to identify a few key similarities across the product of an industry. A helpful simile I’ve created to understand how this works is: the similarities are like the foundation of a building and the different buildings that can be created on top of the individual products. A simple example of this is plumbing. Plumbers learn the foundation of plumbing which allows them to solve almost any plumbing issue. As website developers learn the foundation program which allows them to create any website. This means that people must order a website because making a premade website to suit every need isn’t possible.
Understanding the details of modern innovation is not necessary to compensate for the doubt of one’s objectiveness but knowing the basic structure can help one perceive the importance and extent of influence people’s evaluations hold. Highly aware companies even begin to provide their consumers with innovation they didn’t even know they wanted.
Conclusion
	In conclusion, advertisers and politicians both have developed strategies that manipulate the psychological inclinations people have to either falsely justify their solution to a societal problem, to make the design of something inexplicably appealing, or to influence our decision making process. Although we are constantly experiencing at least one company trying to persuade us to buy or participate in something, my research has concluded that our own brains are the ones who actually play the tricks.
