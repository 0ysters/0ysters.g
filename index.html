Deep in the heart of New Mexico, in Santa Fe, in a large, wealthy house, Artur wakes up from his bed. As the goes to the kitchen to eat his very expensive cereal, he passes a large, ominous door, and sighs. <br>

“I wish I could trick someone into my basement dungeon.” Artur says. “So far, the only person in there is Tristan.”<br>

Faint wailing is heard from the door, but Artur bangs on it to shut it up and moves on while taking a hit.<br>

He eats his cereal, and goes to school. “Maybe this will be the day I finally get someone to love me.” he says.<br>

When he arrives at school, he finds Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar tinkering on a large, mysterious machine.<br>

“We’re done!” Sevar shouts as he throws up his arms!<br>

“This calls for a toast!” Oisin cries, throwing back three glasses of bourbon.<br>

“What is that?” Artur asks while taking a hit.<br>

“We finally finished our cloning machine!” Malcolm says excitedly. “We need something small to test it on. What about you?”<br>

“Okay.” Artur shrugs and walks into the cloning machine. A few seconds later, two Arturs walk out.<br>

“WOW!” Artur says. “Who are you?”<br>

“I’m Artur!” Artur replies. “Who are you?”<br>

“I’m Artur…”<br>

“Looks like the test run worked.” Oisin says. “Let’s test it on more stuff!”<br>

Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar excitedly start testing the cloning machine further, leaving the two Arturs by themselves.<br>

“So… what do you wanna do?”<br>

“I don’t know. Let’s play chess!”<br>

The two Arturs smoke crack and play chess for a while, but every game ends in a draw, and they eventually get bored and go home.<br>

“You know, this is a lot more boring than I thought it would be. We’re just doing things that we do normally.”<br>

“Well, there are things we could do together that we couldn’t do alone…”<br>

Artur glanced knowingly at the bulge in Artur’s pants that seemed to have appeared out of thin air. Artur licked his lips, revealing a lizard-like appendage. <br>

“What’s…” Artur cooed, seductively, hovering an eager hand above the XXL-sized member. Due to the size, he had to raise his hand all the way up, parallel, as a choir of angels sang to accompany the action. “This?”<br>

“Oh…” Artur realized what was going on. “Hot dog!” He exclaims in a Mickey Mouse voice.<br>

The two Arturs close their eyes and reevaluate their lives as they realize what they’re about to do. “I haven’t thought about whale sharks in a long time.” They sing in unison before embracing each other and making sweet, sweet love.<br>

Artur slowly pushes Artur’s pants down to his ankles, then his Spongebob-themed thong down, too. He pushes Artur down onto the chess board. Artur moans and Artur looks at his partner in confusion. He hadn’t even touched him yet. To Artur’s surprise, Artur’s puckered, virgin asshole had been penetrated by a stray bishop.<br>

“Oh, God!” Artur screamed. “For I have never felt such pain nor pleasure in my life!”<br>

Deciding to go with the flow, Artur flipped his partner over and proceeded to move the chess piece in a slow circular motion, slowly expanding his hole. In an aggressive move of passion, he shoved the piece inside. When he attempted to retrieve it, it could not be found.<br>

“Well, fuck,” Artur felt defeated.<br>

“What happened?” Artur asked while taking a hit.<br>

“Uh… guess we might have trouble counting the pieces later,” Artur started to think while taking a hit. <br>

“What the fu-” Artur started to say, only to be cut off by an overwhelming sense of fullness.<br>

“Shit,” Artur knit his eyebrows. “I slipped in :(“<br>

The entire 16 inches of Artur’s throbbing fish cock was pushing the Artur’s inner walls apart, prodding at his stomach, pushing the chess piece further into Artur’s body.<br>

Artur was surprised by the feeling he experienced from the chess piece, but as soon as it was inside him he could not deny the pleasure. He turned his head to the side and saw his keys. Artur hadn’t used these in some time but he realized he had a new purpose for them.<br>

He crawled forward revealing the enormous lizard cock of Artur.<br>

“I know we have a connection, and I know that you would want me to experience the most pleasure… right?” asked Artur.<br>

“Yea, of course” said Artur while taking a hit.<br>

“Well could you grab my keys” Artur asked while taking a hit.<br>

Artur reached his hand out and grabbed Artur’s keys. Once he held them in his hand he realized what Artur wanted. Artur thrusted his hand into Artur’s anus, then he shoves the other hand with the keys in it now with both his hands inside of Artur he reached up into his sternum and unlocked his heart. Artur now understood the true meaning of Thanksgiving, I mean, love.<br>

He felt like he could trust Artur with anything, he could barely speak with so much Artur in one skin, he decided he would communicate with Artur through their lovemaking. But then he got bored of talking, so he decided to switch it up a bit. He reached under his bed and pulled out his pet octopus, named Sucky because of his suction cups.<br>

He explained to Artur, “This is an albino octopus I gave birth to after an octopus saved me from drowning and impregnated me in return. I want you to get him in my ass.”<br>

“Come here little guy. I won’t hurt you.” said Artur while taking a hit.<br>

Reluctantly the octopus climbed up Artur’s leg and felt the smooth, prepubescent sphincter of Artur. It climbed inside of him and, familiar with Artur’s insides, found his placenta and started feeding.<br>

“Oh my,” Artur said, “I haven’t felt that feeling in months.”<br>

“With me, you can feel it anytime.” Artur said. “I’m much slimier than an octopus.”<br>

“Prove it.” Artur said, biting his lip and grinning cheekily.<br>

Artur obliges, climbing inside Artur and filling him with slime, almost as if he was an enormous amoeba. He searches around inside Artur, experimenting with what he can do from the inside. He pulls on a nerve, and Artur jerks his arm.<br>

“Hey, stop that!” said Artur.<br>

“Wait, I want to see what I can do.” Artur says, yanking another nerve. This time, Artur steps forward.<br>

“Can you stop now?” Artur asked while taking a hit.<br>

“No, this is fun!” Artur said. Before long, Artur is doing the chicken dance while injecting heroin into his left eye. “Fine, I’ll stop now.” Artur says. He climbs out, bringing the bishop and keys with him, and the two Arturs, completely exhausted from their adventures, finally go to sleep.<br>

The next morning, the two Arturs wake up and look at each other lovingly.<br>

The orignal Artur pulled out his stash of cocaine and set up a foot long line. The two Artur's began to snort the line from opposite sides.<br>

When they met up in the middle they began to violently lick each others faces while literally eating meth by the handfull.<br>

“I had a great time last night.”<br>

“So did I. But I feel we can do better.”<br>

“What do you mean?”<br>

“Well, last night was fun, but it wasn’t fun enough. Isn’t there a way that we can boost the fun for each of us?”<br>

“Well, I suppose we could see the full capabilities of the cloning machine…”<br>

The two Arturs go back to the cloning machine, where Malcolm, Oisin, and Sevar are still working.<br>

“Hey, Artur, how was your time being cloned?” Sevar asks.<br>

“It was fun. There were some cloning defects… Maybe I wasn’t as small as you thought.” Artur smiles as he recalls the fun times he had with his inhuman apparati.<br>

“We can fix that, if you want.” Oisin hiccups. “We just figured out how to un-clone things.”<br>

“No, no!” Artur says. “I very much enjoy being two people. In fact, that’s why I came here. I want another clone.”<br>

“Another one? I’m not sure if the world can handle that many Arturs.” Malcolm says. Everyone starts laughing.<br>

“Well, it won’t necessarily be me… rather, a part of me, multiple times. Can you do that?” Artur asks.<br>

“I’m not sure.” Sevar responds. “We’ll see what we can do.” He flips on one of the many switches on the machine. “Okay, try it now.”<br>

“Great!” One of the Arturs jumps into the cloning machine, and out walks him and another Artur, except instead of a front side, he just has another back side!<br>

“WOW!” The newest Artur says. “What’s this? I don’t have a face or anything!”<br>

“That’s okay.” Artur says. “You won’t need one for what we want you for.”<br>

The three Arturs return home for another round.<br>

[steamy bit]<br>
